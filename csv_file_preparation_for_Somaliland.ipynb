    "* Travel time\n",
    "* Wind velocity\n",
    "* Clusters **(these clusters should include: The name of the study area, the amount of nighttime lights, population, population living in areas with nighttime light and an ID column)**. The clusters can be downloaded from [Energydata.info](https://energydata.info/) or generated directly using the [following plugin](https://github.com/global-electrification-platform/Clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this there are also some optional datasets that can be used in the analysis:\n",
    "* Custom Demand - A layer that can be created by the users themselves. For the first round of GEP the methodlogy described [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/7/1395) has been used.\n",
